                    <p>I began my career in 1990 at Phoenix PD as a desk aid. I moved to Peoria PD in 1991 and became a
                        certified police officer in 1992. I worked there for 5 years, then moved to Youngtown PD in 1996
                        where I worked as a dispatcher, patrol officer, detective, undercover detective on the HIDTA
                        Task Force combating Methamphetamine, Patrol Sergeant, Academy Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Chief
                        of Police. The Town of Youngtown disbanded the.police department and I went to Wickenburg PD to
